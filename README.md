The project is about developing a version of the game “BattleShip”, basically the objective of the game is to sink your enemy’s ships. In this game, there are two players, the captain and the general, this is essentially a board whereby the enemy’s ships are somewhere on the two player’s boards and are invisible to both players, the players have alternative turns to play and both Captain and General have to guess where the enemy’s ships are on the board then shoot using the row and column positioning but whether it’s a hit or miss, a player has one turn and cannot play twice, once the enemy’s ship has been hit twice it sinks and the player who sunk more ships wins and then either  player chooses whether to play again or not.
